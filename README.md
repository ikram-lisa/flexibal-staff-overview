## Live Example

## Usage

To use the `CollapsibleNav` component, import it into your React component and include it in your JSX:

````jsx
import CollapsibleNav from 'path/to/CollapsibleNav';

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div>
      <CollapsibleNav />
    </div>
  );
}



## Props

This section documents the various props that the `CollapsibleNav` component accepts:


| `isInitiallyCollapsed` | `boolean` | `false` | Determines if the navigation starts in a collapsed state.|

- `Prop`: isInitiallyCollapsed
-This is the actual name of the prop as used in the component. It's the identifier you'll use when passing data to the component.

- `Type`: boolean
-The data type of isInitiallyCollapsed is boolean, meaning it expects a true or false value. This is important for developers to know because it tells them what kind of data they need to provide for this prop.

- `Default`: `false`
- This indicates the default behavior of the CollapsibleNav component if the isInitiallyCollapsed prop is not explicitly provided. In this case, if you donâ€™t specify the isInitiallyCollapsed prop when using CollapsibleNav, it will default to false, meaning the navigation will be expanded by default.
- `Description`: If set to true, the nav will start as a collapsed menu.
<CollapsibleNav isInitiallyCollapsed={true} />

- `Description`:"Determines if the navigation starts in a collapsed state."

This brief description explains the role of the isInitiallyCollapsed prop. When set to true, the navigation component will initially render in a collapsed state. When false or not provided, the component will start in an expanded state. This prop is useful for controlling the initial presentation of the navigation based on user preferences, screen size, or other factors.



## Styling

- `collapsible-nav`: The base class for the component.
- `collapsible-nav--collapsed`: Modifier class used when the navigation is collapsed.
